Description:
  **Statistical Area 2 2023 update**
  
  SA2 2023 is the first major update of the geography since it was first created
  in 2018. The update is to ensure SA2s are relevant and meet criteria before each
  five-yearly population and dwelling census. SA2 2023 contains 135 new SA2s.
  Updates were made to reflect real world change of population and dwelling growth
  mainly in urban areas, and to make some improvements to their delineation of
  communities of interest.
  
  ​
  
  **Description**
  
  This dataset is the definitive version of the annually released statistical area
  2 (SA2) boundaries as at 1 January 2023 as defined by Stats NZ. This version
  contains 2,395 SA2s (2,379 digitised and 16 with empty or null geometries
  (non-digitised)).
  
  ​
  
  SA2 is an output geography that provides higher aggregations of population data
  than can be provided at the statistical area 1 (SA1) level. The SA2 geography
  aims to reflect communities that interact together socially and economically. In
  populated areas, SA2s generally contain similar sized populations.
  
  ​
  
  The SA2 should:
  
  form a contiguous cluster of one or more SA1s,
  
  excluding exceptions below, allow the release of multivariate statistics with
  minimal data suppression,
  
  capture a similar type of area, such as a high-density urban area, farmland,
  wilderness area, and water area,
  
  be socially homogeneous and capture a community of interest. It may have, for
  example:
  
  ​
  
  - a shared road network,
  - shared community facilities,
  - shared historical or social links, or
  - socio-economic similarity,
  
  ​
  
  form a nested hierarchy with statistical output geographies and administrative
  boundaries. It must:
  
  ​
  
  - be built from SA1s,
  - either define or aggregate to define SA3s, urban areas, territorial
  authorities, and regional councils.
  
  ​
  
  SA2s in city council areas generally have a population of 2,000–4,000 residents
  while SA2s in district council areas generally have a population of 1,000–3,000
  residents.
  
  ​
  
  In major urban areas, an SA2 or a group of SA2s often approximates a single
  suburb. In rural areas, rural settlements are included in their respective SA2
  with the surrounding rural area.
  
  ​
  
  SA2s in urban areas where there is significant business and industrial activity,
  for example ports, airports, industrial, commercial, and retail areas, often
  have fewer than 1,000 residents. These SA2s are useful for analysing business
  demographics, labour markets, and commuting patterns.
  
  ​
  
  In rural areas, some SA2s have fewer than 1,000 residents because they are in
  conservation areas or contain sparse populations that cover a large area.
  
  ​
  
  To minimise suppression of population data, small islands with zero or low
  populations close to the mainland, and marinas are generally included in their
  adjacent land-based SA2.
  
  ​
  
  **Zero or nominal population SA2s**
  
  To ensure that the SA2 geography covers all of New Zealand and aligns with New
  Zealand’s topography and local government boundaries, some SA2s have zero or
  nominal populations. These include:
  
  ​
  
  - SA2s where territorial authority boundaries straddle regional council
  boundaries. These SA2s each have fewer than 200 residents and are: Arahiwi,
  Tiroa, Rangataiki, Kaimanawa, Taharua, Te More, Ngamatea, Whangamomona, and
  Mara.
  - SA2s created for single islands or groups of islands that are some distance
  from the mainland or to separate large unpopulated islands from urban areas
  - SA2s that represent inland water, inlets or oceanic areas including: inland
  lakes larger than 50 square kilometres, harbours larger than 40 square
  kilometres, major ports, other non-contiguous inlets and harbours defined by
  territorial authority, and contiguous oceanic areas defined by regional
  council.
  - SA2s for non-digitised oceanic areas, offshore oil rigs, islands, and the Ross
  Dependency. Each SA2 is represented by a single meshblock. The following 16 SA2s
  are held in non-digitised form (SA2 code; SA2 name):
  
  400001; New Zealand Economic Zone, 400002; Oceanic Kermadec Islands, 400003;
  Kermadec Islands, 400004; Oceanic Oil Rig Taranaki, 400005; Oceanic Campbell
  Island, 400006; Campbell Island, 400007; Oceanic Oil Rig Southland, 400008;
  Oceanic Auckland Islands, 400009; Auckland Islands, 400010 ; Oceanic Bounty
  Islands, 400011; Bounty Islands, 400012; Oceanic Snares Islands, 400013; Snares
  Islands, 400014; Oceanic Antipodes Islands, 400015; Antipodes Islands, 400016;
  Ross Dependency.
  
  ​
  
  **SA2 numbering and naming**
  
  Each SA2 is a single geographic entity with a name and a numeric code. The name
  refers to a geographic feature or a recognised place name or suburb. In some
  instances where place names are the same or very similar, the SA2s are
  differentiated by their territorial authority name, for example, Gladstone
  (Carterton District) and Gladstone (Invercargill City).
  
  ​
  
  SA2 codes have six digits. North Island SA2 codes start with a 1 or 2, South
  Island SA2 codes start with a 3 and non-digitised SA2 codes start with a 4. They
  are numbered approximately north to south within their respective territorial
  authorities. To ensure the north–south code pattern is maintained, the SA2 codes
  were given 00 for the last two digits when the geography was created in 2018.
  When SA2 names or boundaries change only the last two digits of the code will
  change.

  Section 2 -- Scope.
  
    a. License grant.
  
         1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
            the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
            non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
            exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
  
              a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
                 in part; and
  
              b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
  
         2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
            Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
            License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
            its terms and conditions.
  
         3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
            6(a).
  
         4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
            Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
            all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
            and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
            Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
            authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
            necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
            technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
            Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
            simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
            (4) never produces Adapted Material.
  
         5. Downstream recipients.
  
              a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
                 recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
                 receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
                 Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                 Public License.
  
              b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                 any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                 apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                 Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                 Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                 Material.
  
         6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
            may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
            are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
            with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
            the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
            provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
  
    b. Other rights.
  
         1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
            licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
            privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
            the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
            assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
            extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
            Rights, but not otherwise.
  
         2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
            Public License.
  
         3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
            collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
            Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
            under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
            licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
            reserves any right to collect such royalties.
  
  Section 3 -- License Conditions.
  
  Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
  following conditions.
  
    a. Attribution.
  
         1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
            form), You must:
  
              a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                 with the Licensed Material:
  
                   i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                      Material and any others designated to receive
                      attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                      the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                      designated);
  
                  ii. a copyright notice;
  
                 iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
  
                  iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                      warranties;
  
                   v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                      extent reasonably practicable;
  
              b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
                 retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
  
              c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
                 Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
                 hyperlink to, this Public License.
  
         2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
            reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
            which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
            reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
            hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
            information.
  
         3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
            information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
            reasonably practicable.
  
         4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
            License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
            Material from complying with this Public License.
  
  Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
  
  Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
  apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
  
    a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
       to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
       portion of the contents of the database;
  
    b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
       contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
       Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
       Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
  
    c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
       all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
  
  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
  replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
  Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
  
  Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
  
    a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
       EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
       AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
       ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
       IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
       WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
       PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
       ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
       KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
       ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
  
    b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
       TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
       NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
       INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
       COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
       USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
       ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
       DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
       IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
  
    c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
       above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
       possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
       waiver of all liability.
  
  Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
  
    a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
       Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
       this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
       terminate automatically.
  
    b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
       Section 6(a), it reinstates:
  
         1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
            it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
            violation; or
  
         2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
  
       For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
       right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
       of this Public License.
  
    c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
       Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
       distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
       will not terminate this Public License.
  
    d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
       License.
  
  Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
  
    a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
       terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
  
    b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
       Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
       independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
  
  Section 8 -- Interpretation.
  
    a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
       shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
       conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
       be made without permission under this Public License.
  
    b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
       deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
       minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
       cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
       without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
       conditions.
  
    c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
       failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
       Licensor.
  
    d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
       as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
       that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
       processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
